Lichen planus can present with white reticular patches and is considered a potentially malignant disorder. Oral candidiasis typically presents as white plaques that can be wiped off, often associated with immunocompromised states or antibiotic use. Suggested diagnostic steps include clinical examination, history taking, and potentially a biopsy for histopathological examination."
