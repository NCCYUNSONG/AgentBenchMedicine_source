Doctor: For the involuntary movements, are they rhythmic (like tremors) or unpredictable jerks? Do they worsen with stress or specific activities? Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in mood, memory, or coordination alongside the \"abnormal behavior\"? Doctor: Any recent infections, head injuries, or family history of neurological disorders? REQUEST TEST: MRI_Brain REQUEST TEST: Swallowing_Assessment REQUEST TEST: Blood_PCR (for inflammation/infection markers) Doctor: Let me check your reflexes and coordination. Can you touch your nose, then my finger, alternating hands? Doctor: Stick out your tongue—any tremors or abnormal movements?

Doctor: Do you have a family history of breast cancer, or have you undergone previous breast biopsies or imaging? REQUEST TEST: Mammogram REQUEST TEST: Ultrasound Doctor: Have you experienced unexplained weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats recently? Doctor: Is the mass movable or fixed to the skin or chest wall? Doctor: Do you use hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy? Doctor: Have you had any recent trauma to the breast area? REQUEST TEST: Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) Doctor: Are you currently menstruating, pregnant, or postmenopausal? Doctor: Has the mass changed with your menstrual cycle? Doctor: Do you smoke or consume alcohol regularly? Doctor: Are there any other areas of concern in the opposite breast? Doctor: How would you describe the texture of the mass—soft, firm, or irregular? Doctor: Have you noticed any redness or warmth over the breast?

Doctor: Are the numbness and weakness in both legs, or just one side? Do they extend below the knee, or stay above? Doctor: Have you had any difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels recently? Doctor: REQUEST TEST: MRI Spine—urgent to rule out spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Doctor: Do you have a history of cancer, infections like tuberculosis, or autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis? Doctor: Have you experienced unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or fevers alongside these symptoms? Doctor: Is the back pain worse at night, or does it improve when lying down? Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your gait or balance, like stumbling? Doctor: REQUEST TEST: Bloodwork (CBC, ESR, CRP, calcium, vitamin D)—to check for inflammation, infection, or metabolic causes. Doctor: Do you engage in heavy physical labor or repetitive movements that strain your lower back? Doctor: Have you had prior back surgeries or chronic back issues? Doctor: When you say \"weakness,\" can you still walk normally, or do your legs feel like they might give out? Doctor: Is the numbness constant, or does it come and go? Does it feel like pins and needles, or more like a loss of sensation? Doctor: Have you tried any treatments so far, like rest, medication, or physical therapy? If so, did they help? Doctor: Do you have a family history of neurologic or spinal disorders? Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications, including steroids or blood thinners? Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth over the painful area of your back?
