    "answer": "The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the presence of a long, curved seta in Grimmia curviseta, which is absent or very short in Grimmia montana. This causes the capsule of Grimmia curviseta to be exserted and often nodding, while in Grimmia montana the capsule is immersed or emergent and erect.",

    "answer": "The protein described is a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein. HLH proteins are a class of transcription factors that typically bind to specific DNA sequences (E-box motifs) in the promoter regions of genes to regulate gene expression, rather than binding to a specific receptor domain in the traditional sense of a ligand-receptor interaction. Therefore, its 'receptor domain' would be a DNA sequence. Given its role in activating the MAP pathway and its overexpression in neurological disorders, leading to increased neuroinflammation, this protein could potentially be used as a prognostic marker. Its involvement in promoting cell survival, proliferation, and gene upregulation suggests it plays a direct role in the progression of the pathology, making it more than just an adjunct marker.",
    "correct_answer": "S100B binds more strongly to the VC1 domain of RAGE than the V domain and, due to its low specificity, can be used as an adjunct marker."
